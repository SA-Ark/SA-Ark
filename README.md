# About-Me

I am a sales professional turned software engineer with a passion for technology that began in my early years with the discovery of online gaming. Through my schooling and work experience, I developed a love for problem-solving and an entrepreneurial spirit. After gaining valuable experience as a sales professional and a computer science tutor, I became passionate about the technical aspects of the job and was fascinated with machine learning, cybersecurity, and AI. I challenged myself to do more with my knowledge and built scalable, user-friendly web applications while continuing to teach myself new technologies. I love and excel at what I do and am currently looking for interesting, innovative, and impactful challenges to nurture my curiosity and further develop my expertise. With excellent pair programming and mentoring skills honed by my diverse experiences, I am excited to contribute my skills to your team.
